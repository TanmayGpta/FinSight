Absolutely — here’s your full progress update for today, formatted clearly and concisely for tracking in Notepad or your project log:

---

## ✅ FinSight Project

---

### 1. ✅ Dataset Preparation

* Used a cleaned CSV with quarterly data (2017–2024) for 12 major German companies (Volkswagen AG, Siemens AG, etc.).
* Fields included:
  `Company`, `Year`, `Quarter`, `Revenue`, `Net Income`, `Liabilities`, `Assets`, `Equity`, `ROA`, `ROE`, `Debt to Equity`.
* Cleaned float/integer formats for consistent SQL compatibility.
* Final cleaned dataset saved as:
  ➤ `data/updated_file.csv`

---

### 2. ✅ MySQL Integration

* MySQL database created: `FinSight`
* Table: `financial_data` with appropriate fields and types
* Confirmed structure using MySQL Workbench.

---

### 3. ✅ Python Data Import Script

* Script path: `backend/services/upload_csv.py`
* Uses `mysql.connector` to connect to the DB.
* Reads from `data/updated_file.csv`, inserts all rows into `financial_data` table.
* Adjusted to handle both integers and floats cleanly.
* Executed via terminal:
  ➤ `python backend/services/upload_csv.py`
* Confirmed data insertion into MySQL.

---

### 4. ✅ FastAPI Backend Setup

* Installed dependencies:
  `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `mysql-connector-python`, `python-dotenv`

* FastAPI entry point file:
  ➤ `main.py`
  **Purpose:** Starts FastAPI app, includes routers for API endpoints.

* API routes file:
  ➤ `api/routes.py`
  **Purpose:** Contains backend API logic to fetch data.

* Endpoint `/api/financials`:

  * Returns all rows from the `financial_data` table in JSON format.
  * Connected to DB, tested successfully.

* Tested using Swagger UI:
  ➤ `uvicorn main:app --reload`
  **Swagger UI** helps during development to confirm route functionality — not needed in final app.

---

### 5. ✅ Additional Endpoints & Filtering

* Added filters to `/api/financials` → query by company & year.
* Created new endpoints:
  ➤ `/api/summary` → aggregated data per company/year
  ➤ `/api/forecast` → placeholder for future ML predictions
  ➤ `/api/companies`, `/api/years` → return distinct values for dropdowns in frontend

---

### 6. ✅ Frontend Initialization (React)

* Used Vite + React to create frontend in:
  ➤ `frontend/`

* Restructured folders:
  `components/`, `pages/`, `reports/`, `tests/`

* Main page:
  ➤ `frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.jsx`

* Setup routing via:
  ➤ `App.jsx → loads Dashboard.jsx`

* Created custom UI components:
  * `Card`, `CardContent`, `Button`, `Select`, etc.
* Currently rendering summary button + dropdowns (non-interactive — pending improvements tomorrow)
